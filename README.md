## Introduction
This is my first attempt at developing an iOS application. This is a very primitive calculator with basic operations and a, currently, underwhelming interface. Features include:
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
  * Successive operations are be performed on the current result
* Equals button
  * Additional presses of the equals button repeats the last calculation on the current result
* Clear button

## Possible Improvements
Improvements will be made as I learn more about app development. Some improvements which could be made:
* Usability
  * UI improvements
  * Deleting characters from a number in case of misclick
* Functionality
  * Memory functionality
  * 'Advanced' operations
  * Persistence, such as a history or the remembering the last result
  * Undo/redo
* Code base
  * Documentation
  * Testing
  * Improved code structure
    * Architectural patterns (e.g. MVVM)
